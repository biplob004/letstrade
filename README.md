# letstrade
letstrade is a free and open source stock trading bot written in Python. It is designed to support Alpaca API for now but our primary focus right now is adding more brokers. It contains backtesting, plotting and money management tools as well as strategy optimization.
This bot was inspired by Freqtrade which is a free and open source crypto trading bot.
Since this is connected to Alpaca is does support some crypto pairs but this bot was created for use with stocks. If you want a crypto trading bot use Freqtrade it would be better for crypto trading.
This bot hosted in a docker image and uses supervisord to run 2 executables at once so you get a simple UI to run back tests and manage stocks you are invested in while also having a trading bot running in the background.

# Quick Start Guide 
This section explains how to run the bot with Docker. It is not meant to work out of the box. You'll still need to read through the documentation and understand how to properly configure it.
### Install Docker ###
Start by downloading and installing Docker CE for your platform: <br>
Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/ <br>
Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/ <br>
Linux: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ <br>

### Get your Alpaca API keys ###
#### Either create or login to alpaca ####
Letstrade is not sponsored or affiliated with alpaca trade api. This is the first of many brokers that will be available for you to connect to lets trade. <br>

If you want to switch from paper trading to live remove paper- from the url endpt. 
Once you see your API key and API secret key note it down somewhere safe. <br>
**Do not share these numbers with anyone.**
#### Open the repo in your code editor of choice ####
Enter your API keys into the config file. 
#### For Linux ####
We suggest either downloading WINSCP for windows or CyberDuck for mac and editing files on your linux device that way or through VI if you know how to use that one. 
But we all know the software memes about using vi. ðŸ˜‚

### Run Docker ###
#### Build Image ####
On windows and Mac the easiest was to build the image is by installing the docker extension and typing right clicking on the docker file and pressing docker build. 
Then press on the whale icon and find the image under images and press docker run. 

On linux you should cd into the directory and type the command 
docker build letstrade:latest 
docker run letstrade:latest
